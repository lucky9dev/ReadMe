										<h5>2016 October - 2017 May</h5>
										<h4>Web & App Developer - Freelancer</h4>
										<p>This is an Australian freelance marketplace website, which allows potential employers to post jobs that freelancers can

											<br/>
										<p>At that time, I set out on this path to verify and further improve the skills that I had accumulated up to that point. In the
											process of carrying out several projects, I came to possess excellent knowledge about MVC, CI/CD, and many
											frameworks and Version control systems like GitHub, Bitbucket. I raised my skills to a higher level by boldly
											challenging new projects.</p>
